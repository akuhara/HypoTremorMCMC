# Step 6: Statistical Analysis

In this step, we employ the program `hypo_tremor_statistics` to compute the 95% confidence intervals for all model parameters. 
These calculations are based on the output files generated by `hypo_tremor_MCMC`. 
Additionally, the program is designed to identify and eliminate potential event duplications occurring across adjacent time segments.

Below, you'll find descriptions of the output files:

## hypo.stat
This file contains event locations, determined by the median of MCMC samples, along with their respective 95% confidence intervals.

## hypo.stat.removed
Similar to hypo.stat, this file also includes event information. However, any duplicated events are removed. ]
If an event's median hypocenter falls within the 95% confidence interval of a successive event, or vice versa, 
both events are considered identical, and those from later time segments are systematically discarded.

## station_corrections.stat
This file contains the station-specific correction factors for arrival time delays and amplifications. 
It reports both the median value and the 95% confidence interval.
 
## uniform_structure.stat
This file contains Vs and Qs estimations.
It reports both the median value and the 95% confidence interval.
